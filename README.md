[install][github-url]
=====================

A bunch of scripts for installing software which ins't avaiable in popular pacakage managers. 
e.g. [SDL2][sdl2]


Disclaimer
==========

These scripts can link to other scripts hosted by other people on the web.
These other scripts can change at any time without warning - someone could easily drop a [`:(){ :|:& };:`][forkbomb] or worse in there.
It is your own personal resposibility to look through the code which will run before you execute it.
If in doubt, **do not run the scripts.**
